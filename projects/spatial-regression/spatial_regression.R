# output: 0.85, far larger than the near-0 null expectation, tiny p-value.
# conclusion: under-5 mortality rates are strongly positively spatially autocorrelated.

# spatial autocorrelation ------------------------------------------------------
# explore spatial autocorrelation using different neighbor definitions and variables


# linear regression model ------------------------------------------------------
# simple OLS model
ols1 <- lm(nevents ~ u5mr, data = df2)

# plot the residuals (unexplained variance)
df2$residuals <- residuals(ols1)
tm_shape(df2) + 
  tm_fill(col = "residuals", palette = "RdBu", n = 9) +

# it looks like there's clear spatial autocorrelation in the residuals

# test for spatial autocorrelation in the residuals
lm.morantest(model = ols1, listw = dat_listw_w, zero.policy = TRUE)
# Moran's I â‰ˆ 0.176 >> expectation (-0.003), highly significant. 
# conclusion: the residuals are not randomly spatially distributed, and the OLS model misses the spatial data structure.


# Spatial regression models ----------------------------------------------------
# Spatial lag model
sar.fit <- lagsarlm(nevents ~ u5mr, 
                    df2, listw = dat_listw_w, 
                    na.action = na.omit, zero.policy = TRUE)

# Spatial error model
sem.fit <- errorsarlm(nevents ~ u5mr, 
                      df2, listw = dat_listw_w, 
                      na.action = na.omit, zero.policy = TRUE)

screenreg(list(ols1, sar.fit, sem.fit)) # LR test


# Explore the models ------------------------------------
AIC(ols1, sar.fit, sem.fit)  # model fit is worse on OLS, similar on SAR and SEM 

# ols: fix assumptions before testing
dat_listw_w <- spdep::nb2listw(dat_nb, style = "W", zero.policy = TRUE)
# run tests
lm.LMtests(model = ols1, listw = dat_listw_w, zero.policy = TRUE, test = c("LMerr", "LMlag","RLMerr", "RLMlag"))
# conclusion: mixed dependence? both the simple lag and error tests are significant, but the robust ones are not.
# the jury's out on whether a spatilal lag (SAR) or error model (SEM) make the best fit.

# Assess impacts in spatial lag models -------------------------------------------------
spatialreg::impacts(obj = sar.fit, listw = dat_listw_w) # direct: avg change in Y given 1 unit increase in X.

# impacts:
# Direct Impact (4.194185): This value represents the average change in the dependent variable (the number of events, nevents) 
# in a given location due to a one-unit change in the independent variable (under-5 mortality rate, u5mr), 
# holding the values of u5mr constant in all other locations.
# In simpler terms, it's the impact that changes in the under-5 mortality rate 
# have on the number of events in the same area. The positive value indicates that as the under-5 mortality rate increases, 
# the number of events in that same location tends to increase.


# Indirect Impact (Spillover Effect)
# Indirect Impact (1.952575): This value quantifies the spillover effect or the impact of changing the under-5 mortality rate 
# in one location on the number of events in neighboring locations. It captures the spatial externalities or the influence that 
# a unit's characteristics have on neighboring units. The positive indirect impact suggests that an increase in the 
# under-5 mortality rate in one area not only affects that area but also leads to an increase in the number of events in surrounding areas.


# Total Impact (6.146759): This is the sum of the direct and indirect impacts, representing the overall effect of a change 
# in the under-5 mortality rate on the number of events, accounting for both the local and neighboring effects. 
# The positive total impact indicates that, overall, higher under-5 mortality rates are associated with a higher number of events 
# across the study area, considering both direct and spillover effects.
